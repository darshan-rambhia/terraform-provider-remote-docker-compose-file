# remote_docker_compose_file Provider

The remote_docker_compose_file provider manages Docker Compose files on remote hosts via SSH.

This provider:
- Uploads docker-compose files to remote hosts
- Optionally runs 'docker compose up -d' and 'docker compose down'
- Tracks file state in Terraform (not container state)
- Validates compose files before applying
- Supports bastion/jump hosts for multi-hop SSH

## Schema

### Optional

- `bastion_host` (String) Default bastion/jump host address for multi-hop SSH connections.
- `bastion_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_key_path if not set.
- `bastion_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for bastion host (sensitive).
- `bastion_port` (Number) Default bastion host SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `bastion_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content for bastion host (sensitive). Falls back to ssh_private_key if not set.
- `bastion_user` (String) Default SSH user for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_user if not set.
- `insecure_ignore_host_key` (Boolean) Skip SSH host key verification. WARNING: This is insecure and should only be used for testing. Defaults to false. Deprecated: Use strict_host_key_checking = "no" instead.
- `known_hosts_file` (String) Path to a custom known_hosts file for SSH host key verification. Defaults to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
- `ssh_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH certificate content for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_certificate_path` (String) Default path to SSH certificate file for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file. Mutually exclusive with ssh_private_key.
- `ssh_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for password authentication (sensitive). Use this as an alternative to key-based authentication.
- `ssh_port` (Number) Default SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `ssh_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content (sensitive). Mutually exclusive with ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_user` (String) Default SSH user for connections. Can be overridden per-resource.
- `strict_host_key_checking` (String) SSH host key checking mode. Valid values: "yes" (default, requires host key in known_hosts), "no" (insecure, skip verification), "accept-new" (accept and save new host keys, reject changed keys).
