# remote-docker-compose-file Provider

The docker_compose provider manages Docker Compose files on remote hosts via SSH.

This provider:
- Uploads docker-compose files to remote hosts
- Optionally runs 'docker compose up -d' and 'docker compose down'
- Tracks file state in Terraform (not container state)
- Validates compose files before applying
- Supports bastion/jump hosts for multi-hop SSH

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "remote_docker_compose_file" {
  ssh_user     = "root"
  ssh_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"
}

resource "remote_docker_compose_file_stack" "app" {
  host        = "192.168.1.100"
  remote_path = "/opt/stacks/app/docker-compose.yaml"
  content     = file("docker-compose.yaml")
  up          = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `bastion_host` (String) Default bastion/jump host address for multi-hop SSH connections.
- `bastion_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_key_path if not set.
- `bastion_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for bastion host (sensitive).
- `bastion_port` (Number) Default bastion host SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `bastion_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content for bastion host (sensitive). Falls back to ssh_private_key if not set.
- `bastion_user` (String) Default SSH user for bastion host. Falls back to ssh_user if not set.
- `insecure_ignore_host_key` (Boolean) Skip SSH host key verification. WARNING: This is insecure and should only be used for testing. Defaults to false.
- `ssh_certificate` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH certificate content for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_certificate_path` (String) Default path to SSH certificate file for certificate authentication. Used with ssh_private_key or ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_key_path` (String) Default path to SSH private key file. Mutually exclusive with ssh_private_key.
- `ssh_password` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH password for password authentication (sensitive). Use this as an alternative to key-based authentication.
- `ssh_port` (Number) Default SSH port. Defaults to 22.
- `ssh_private_key` (String, Sensitive) Default SSH private key content (sensitive). Mutually exclusive with ssh_key_path.
- `ssh_user` (String) Default SSH user for connections. Can be overridden per-resource.
